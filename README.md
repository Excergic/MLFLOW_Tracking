# Housing Price Prediction with MLflow 

This project demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow for predicting housing prices using MLflow to track experiments, log metrics, and manage model versions.

## Features  
ðŸ‘‰Model Training: Random Forest Regressor with hyperparameter tuning.  
ðŸ‘‰Experiment Tracking: MLflow to log parameters, metrics, and models.  
ðŸ‘‰Hyperparameter Optimization: Grid search to find the best model configuration.  
ðŸ‘‰Model Evaluation: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) used as the evaluation metric.  
ðŸ‘‰Model Deployment: MLflow's model registry for easy deployment.  

## Setup and Requirements  
### Prerequisites  

1. Python 3.8+
2. Libraries:  
          mlflow  
          scikit-learn  
          pandas
